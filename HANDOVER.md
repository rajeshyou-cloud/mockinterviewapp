# Handover

Read `PROJECT_STATE.md` first; it is the authoritative product status and completion record.

## Product

Mock Interview System is a production-deployed candidate-practice application for Snowflake and Informatica. The completed milestone includes 300 questions, stable interview sampling, voice/text answers, structured scoring, Neon persistence, secure cross-device resume, and topic-level completion reports.

Production: https://mockinterviewapp-web.vercel.app

## Runtime flow

1. The browser creates a UUID session and 64-hex-character resume credential.
2. `GET /api/questions` returns a stable, session-seeded sample of 10 reviewed questions.
3. `POST /api/score` resolves the question and rubric on the server, then uses the configured scorer.
4. On Vercel, the scorer attempts AI Gateway and falls back deterministically on provider failure.
5. Session and answer routes store progress in Neon while local storage preserves graceful browser fallback.
6. Cloud routes require the private resume credential; Neon stores only its SHA-256 hash.
7. Refresh or cross-device resume restores the current question, submitted answer, scoring feedback, and progress.
8. Completion stores the final average and renders topic-level strengths/gaps.

The production web app uses self-contained Next.js routes for scoring and persistence. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` affects question retrieval only and is optional. The standalone FastAPI service remains independently deployable and exposes `/health`, `/v1/questions`, and a baseline `/v1/score` contract.

## Scoring configuration

- Default Vercel model: `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`
- Force baseline: `SCORING_PROVIDER=deterministic`
- Force gateway: `SCORING_PROVIDER=gateway`
- Override model: `SCORING_MODEL=<gateway-model-id>`
- Local gateway credential: `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
- Vercel authentication: automatically supplied OIDC when AI Gateway is enabled for the team

The current Vercel team needs a payment card before Gateway calls are serviced. Until then, production safely returns `ai-gateway:...->deterministic-keyword`, and the UI labels the result as an explainable baseline evaluation. Do not remove the fallback or claim live AI scoring until a production response returns an `ai-gateway:` provider without `->`.

## Authentication configuration

Neon Managed Auth is enabled on the production database branch. Vercel Production contains `NEON_AUTH_BASE_URL` and a sensitive `NEON_AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET`; neither value belongs in Git. `apps/web/.env.example` documents the required names for local setup. The public interview remains accessible without an account, while `/account`, `/review`, `/recruiter`, and `/billing` are authentication-protected. Role authorization for the staff routes is the next identity task.

## Verification commands

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run test:web
npm run build:web
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

From `apps/api`:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Current verified counts are 45 web tests and 8 API tests. Live-content tests require exactly 300 valid, unique reviewed questions and sufficient coverage for every released technology/difficulty pair. Candidate-content tests separately enforce 150 unique questions, 50 per difficulty, complete rubrics, and official-source hosts for Databricks, Oracle Database, Power BI, Python, and AWS.

## Deployment

- Repository: `rajeshyou-cloud/mockinterviewapp`
- Web Vercel project: `mockinterviewapp-web`, Root Directory `apps/web`
- API Vercel project: `mockinterviewapp-api`
- Database: Neon project `mockinterviewapp`, `DATABASE_URL` bound server-side to web Production/Preview
- Both Vercel projects deploy `main` automatically

The final live transaction verified create, answer write, wrong-credential rejection, authorized read-back with restored index, and completion. Its disposable rows were deleted.

## Deferred roadmap

Milestone 3 has a live searchable Question Bank UI plus complete 150-question Databricks, Oracle Database, Power BI, Python, and AWS candidate packs. Their 124 unique official source links passed reachability validation on 2026-08-23. Candidate packs remain hidden until human approval and full launch verification. Replay, recruiter analytics/comparison, human reviewer/admin tools, user authentication, and billing are part of the active completion goal.
